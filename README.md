  Through this process, there were multiple times I showcased proper coding standards. When creating new variables and functions, I was always warry to name them something that would make sense to me in the future. In addition to that, I try my best to create functions that best reflect their logic, seperating functions if needed but essentially making sure that they would serve one specific purpose. All the function names like findById or update. In addition to coding practices, during the stage when I was creating comments, at first I added comments that would help me learn better. As time went on, I not longer needed them so I cleaned them up with minimal comments and only include important comments like explanation of intent. In addition to comments, I made sure leave plenty of blank lines between code for readability. For this repository, I used feature branching as my workflow. One thing I would like to improve is maybe change the ProductData to a hash map for more efficient reasons. All in all, I think my code is satisfactory.

Writing unit tests is an essential practice to ensure that individual components of a program function as expected. However, determining the right number of unit tests in a class depends on the complexity of the functionality being tested. A well-structured test suite should cover all possible scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure robustness. One way to measure the effectiveness of tests is through code coverage, which indicates the percentage of code that is executed during testing. While achieving 100% code coverage is beneficial, it does not necessarily guarantee the absence of bugs, as it does not account for logical errors, unexpected input handling, or integration issues. Therefore, while high code coverage is a useful metric, it should be complemented with thorough test case design and real-world scenario testing.

When expanding a test suite, code cleanliness becomes a crucial consideration. If a new functional test suite, such as verifying the number of items in the product list, is implemented with redundant setup procedures and instance variables, it may lead to code duplication and reduced maintainability. Writing similar test classes without reusing existing code can make future updates and debugging more challenging. To improve code quality, common functionalities should be extracted into reusable methods or base classes to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Additionally, organizing tests logically and ensuring a clear separation of concerns enhances readability and maintainability, making the test suite more efficient and scalable. By focusing on these principles, we can create a well-structured test suite that is both comprehensive and easy to manage.
