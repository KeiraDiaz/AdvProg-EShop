  Through this process, there were multiple times I showcased proper coding standards. When creating new variables and functions, I was always warry to name them something that would make sense to me in the future. In addition to that, I try my best to create functions that best reflect their logic, seperating functions if needed but essentially making sure that they would serve one specific purpose. All the function names like findById or update. In addition to coding practices, during the stage when I was creating comments, at first I added comments that would help me learn better. As time went on, I not longer needed them so I cleaned them up with minimal comments and only include important comments like explanation of intent. In addition to comments, I made sure leave plenty of blank lines between code for readability. For this repository, I used feature branching as my workflow. One thing I would like to improve is maybe change the ProductData to a hash map for more efficient reasons. All in all, I think my code is satisfactory.
